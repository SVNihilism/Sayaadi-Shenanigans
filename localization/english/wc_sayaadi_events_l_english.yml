 WCSS_1_TITLE: "Starting Off With a Bang"
 WCSS_1_DESC: "The entire area is littered with dismembered troll body parts and fel fire. \n\n"That was amazing!" Nehra screamed, "I didn't know there were troll warlocks." \n\nNazri chuckled, "After today, I don't think there will be." She looked around, "If there's trolls, this has to be Azeroth, that place the Burning Legion is going to take over. How is that even possible?" \n\n"Who cares? Think of all the new things we can murder!" \n\nNazri's face lit up, "Think of all the women!"\n\nNazri reigned in her excitement as she looked at her sister, "We're not going to repeat the incubus incident, okay?"\n\nNehra rolled her eyes, "Yes, cause I was the problem!""
 WCSS_1_OPT: "Here's My Plan!"

 WCSS_2_TITLE: "Start of Something Special"
 WCSS_2_DESC: "Nazri stands on top of a torso, "Alright, sis, here's the plan! First! We start a new cult! We'll make it so it's girls only, of course." \n\n"Ooo, and we get to torture and murder everyone who's not us!" \n\n"Second! We seduce the most powerful women around!" \n\n"You mean YOU seduce..." \n\n"Third! We take over their forces to help us defend against all the jealous men!" \n\n"Dibs on the men!" Nehra gave a sadistic grin.\n\n"Fourth! I create a harem so powerful I ascend to levels so unfathomable that even Sargeras will tremble before me!" \n\n"Uhh, we'll call that last part a work in progress.""
 WCSS_2_OPT: "This is going to be so fun!"

#GUL'DAN

 WCSS_guldan_1_TITLE: "Loot!"
 WCSS_guldan_1_DESC: ""Dibs on the skull!" Nehra shouted after she picked up Gul'dan's severed head, "What's the best way to get rid of all the fleshy bits?"\n\nNazri picked up the tome he carried with him, "This is a grimoire!" she realized.\n\n"Is that one of those lewd picture books?" Nehra asked confused.\n\n"Almost as good! This contains all the spells he made, it's how he bound other demons and did all his summony stuff!" She squeeked in excitement, "Do you know what this means?"\n\n"You're about to meddle with powers you don't understand, that will very likely blow up in our faces and potentially get us killed?"\n\n"YES! It'll be amazing!" Nazri giggled.\n\nNehra rolled her eyes but she couldn't stop from grinning."  
 WCSS_guldan_1_OPT: "What's This?"

 WCSS_guldan_3_TITLE: "Orb of Domination"
 WCSS_guldan_3_DESC: "Nazri picks up the final item, a dark purple orb. She should feel a connection between it and something else and tugged.\n\nNothing seemed to happen as Nazri stared at the orb. It gave off a similar feel to her Charm ability, something related to the mind. "Anything good?" Nehra asked.\n\n"Doesn't look like it" Nazri responded. As she was about to toss it, an orc woman with odd eyes popped up in front of her.\n\n"Mistress" She spoke.\n\nNehra paused, "Did you just summon an orc?".\n\nNazri squeeled, "She's part Draenei!". The Orc's eyes widened at the comment.\n\n"So the orb conjures fantasies?" Nehra asked, clearly losing interest."  
 WCSS_guldan_3_OPT: "This is Amazing!"

 WCSS_guldan_4_TITLE: "Garona the Mindbound"
 WCSS_guldan_4_DESC: ""Even better!" Nazri crushed the orb, "She's a real person!".\n\nThe orc's reaction was immediate as she collapsed to her knees. She stared at her shaking hands in disbelief, and then looked up, "You freed me?"\n\nNazri put her hand on her chest in fake outrage, "I'm not some pathetic trash that needs magical items to enslave people's mind! That's ama-"\n\nThe orc interrupted Nazri as she suddenly rose and hugged her while in tears, "Thank you! You have no idea how awful it is to not have control of your own mind!".\n\nNehra grinned in amusement.\n\n"Yes! Absolutely! Hey, since I freed you and all, how do you feel about joining my harem?""   
 WCSS_guldan_4_OPT: "Since When is Mind Control Bad?" 

 WCSS_guldan_5_TITLE: "Practically Already Mine"
 WCSS_guldan_5_DESC: ""So to summarize, you're a sex demon who wants to create a lesbian harem, take over the world, and kill some god who is imprisoning your kind and making them invade worlds..."\n\n"Yep!" Nazri replied cheerfully.\n\nGarona stared at her for a moment before responding. "I appreciate you saving me, but i'm not into women, i'm not even sure how that would work!"\n\n"Not into women yet!" Nazri corrected, as if it explained everything.\n\n"I don't mind helping you for freeing me, but I don't know about becoming one of your wives."\n\nNazri put a hand on her shoulder with a gentle smile, "That's okay, It's like I read in My Mage Mistress: Bound by Magic, sometimes you need to take it slow and not rush into things!""   
 WCSS_guldan_5_OPT: "Time to Sell the Extra Loot!" 

#DRAKA

 WCSS_Draka_1_TITLE: "Draka the Warrior"
 WCSS_Draka_1_DESC: ""It looks like the invasion has started, they've created a portal to this planet from Draenor and the fel orcs are the vanguard." \n\n"Well that certainly speeds up the timeline for our harem." \n\n"YOUR harem," her sister quickly corrected. \n\n"Wait! Did you see any sexy orcs?" \n\nHer sister slightly recoiled at the question. "You'd bed an ORC? They're hideous!" \n\n"But those muscles! And that dominant savage aura! Imagine how hot it is to make something so dominant submit." \n\nHer sister paused at the thought before nodding slightly, "I wouldn't mind one under my boot. Well, there is a famous chieftess amongst them. I think her name was Draka, she seemed less physically offensive than the rest.""
 WCSS_draka_1_OPT: "Sounds Perfect!"

 WCSS_Draka_2_TITLE: "The Start of Negotiations"
 WCSS_Draka_2_DESC: "What have you captured me for, felspawn?" Draka sounded almost annoyed at her prediciment. \n\n"I have decided you are going to be my new wife and the start of my new harem!" Nazri exclaimed. \n\nDraka's eyes widened at the absurdity of the statement. "Wha-But i'm a woman!" she managed to sputter out, clearly confused at her situation. \n\nNazri grinned devilishly as she closed the distance between them. The orc thought she would stop before her, but the succubus continued until she felt her breasts pressed against hers. She was now pinned to the stone wall with the succubus a mere inch from her face. Her breath caressed her skin with lust clearly radiated from her gaze. "You'll find that when it comes to pleasure, women simply do it better!" \n\nDraka panicked, "But I already have a chosen!""
 WCSS_draka_2_OPT: "Oh, we can fix that!"

 WCSS_Draka_3_TITLE: "A Pact is Sealed!"
 WCSS_Draka_3_DESC: "Ah, I think I know the one, the Chieftain? I saw as he was powerless when I took you from him, I bet he often finds himself powerless when it comes to you." \n\nDraka's face darkened at the words, Nazri grinned. \n\n"You'll find i'm not nearly so powerless. I can offer you things you never even dreamed of! There's the obvious, eternal beauty, love, pleasure..." she trailed her fingers gently across her skin, "but the less obvious, the more important, is what I can help you become. You have such potential that is constantly smothered by the men around you. I want to take that spark inside you and turn it into an inferno. I have no need for a mere companion, I demand you stand amongst demi-gods." \n\n"Honeyed words mean nothing to me..." She paused, hope sparked in her eyes briefly before it was smothered, "If you truly think yourself so capable, bring me the head of the orc Gul'dan, protect my son, and I shall accept my fate!""
 WCSS_draka_3_OPT: "The Pact Binds Her!"

 WCSS_Draka_4_TITLE: "Selling Off Loose Ends"
 WCSS_Draka_4_DESC: ""100 gold?! You must be out of your mind! I could buy a hundred strong men for that price!" The man countered. \n\n"Ah, but he's worth an army! He's the child of two of the strongest members of their race, his potential as a warrior and a leader is cle-" \n\nShe was interrupted by a child's cries.\n\nAnnoyed by the interruption Nazri cast Charm. "Stop crying!" The boy's cries were silenced as he stared into space.\n\nThe slaver looked at her with a raised brow, "What? Crying is annoying! It's not like it'll turn his developing mind into mush!" She took a second glance at the boy, "Probably..." He started to drool. "Whatever, 50 gold!" \n\nThe man sighed, "Fine. Henry, give the she-demon the gold and put my new thrall in the hold.""
 WCSS_draka_4_OPT: "50 Gold is 50 Gold!"

 WCSS_Draka_5_TITLE: "A Deal is a Deal!"
 WCSS_Draka_5_DESC: ""He's truly dead?" Draka stared at you in disbelief. \n\n"Nehra turned his skull into a trophy!" Nazri replied cheerfully. \n\n"I suppose it was obvious that the very forces he wished to become master over were what consumed him in the end." \n\n"I also took care of your son." Nazri added.\n\n"What do you mean take care of?" she growled. \n\n"As in I found him a safer place to grow up. You told me to protect him, not surround him with hostile forces and constant murder. Don't worry, he'll still learn to fight and other orc stuff!" \n\nDraka's shock morphed into rage, "You trecherous fel spawn! I may be pact bound to marry you but until my son is back in my arms don't expect to touch a hair on my head!" She stormed away." 
 WCSS_draka_5_OPT: "Why is She Mad?"

WCSS_Draka_6_TITLE: "A Messy Divorce!"
WCSS_Draka_6_DESC: ""Durotan! I challenge you to Mak'gora!" The surrounding orcs looked shocked and confused, but not as much as Durotan himself. \n\n"My love, what is the meaning of this?" \n\n"Your weakness! Your failure! Time and time again you have failed me and now our son! You have failed in your duties as an orc and a man!" She spit into his face. His face morphed into rage at the insult. The orcs surrounded the couple.\n\n"So be it!" Durotan swung his fist at his wife but she clearly knew his moves well as she effortlessly dodged the attack and swept the feet from under him. Before he could react she was on top of him and tore out his throat with her tusks. He flailed around in his death throes as your gazes met. Her eyes were clouded in battle lust as she spat out part of his windpipe. \n\n"We're going to be best friends!" Nehra said from behind you." 
WCSS_draka_6_OPT: "Accept Reward!"

WCSS_Draka_7_TITLE: "You're a Warlock, Nazri!"
WCSS_Draka_7_DESC: "Nazri's new wife was being unreasonably unfun! She had been ranting about how she needs to get her child back for days! He's probably on some boat in the middle of the ocean right now! However that gave her plenty of time to look through Gul'dan's grimoire and she discovered how he was utilizing fel magic!\n\nShe learned three core spells so far:\n\n#Bold Ritual of Summoning:#! Summon a willing ally to you, even from [prison|E].\n\n#Bold Soul Link:#! Normally will link your life force with a demon, stealing their life if harmed. But as a demon this link can go much further, such as sharing life span itself!\n\n#Bold Summon Demon:#! Make a link with a demon and summon them to you, even against their will.\n\nShe giggled at how she was going to use this on Nehra!"
WCSS_Draka_7_OPT: "She Won't Know What Summoned Her!"

#LIANNE

WCSS_LIANNE_0_TITLE: "The Summoning"
WCSS_LIANNE_0_DESC: "Nazi could feel a weak beacon of fel energy in the north, so faint she almost missed it. With her newfound knowledge, she could tell someone was trying to summon a demon. Except their attempt is clearly too amateurish to connect to The Twisting Nether, let alone bound a demon, but it does sound like potential fun... \n\nOn one hand it could be a desperate soul that would easily succumb to her charms.\n\nBut on the other it could also be a trap meant to force her to endure unspeakable horrors.\n\nAs she pondered her choice she could hear Draka's footsteps approach. \n\nShe quickly reached out to hijack the spell!"
WCSS_LIANNE_0_OPT: "Connect to the Summon!"

WCSS_LIANNE_1_TITLE: "A Desperate Plea"
WCSS_LIANNE_1_DESC: ""Oh my! It worked!"\n\nNazri raised a brow at the naked woman. "And am I glad it did, what a delicious specimen you are!" Nazri paused for a second to appreciate her life choices, "You're quite bold, I love it!"\n\n"I-I didn..." The woman stammered as a blush rose to her cheeks. "Does your kind come in the form of our deepest desires?" She managed to get out. \n\nNazri's face bloomed in a radiant smile, "Deepest desires is it?" She stepped forward as the woman who froze in place. "This is my true form, but if i'm your deepest desire, maybe fate is at play." She trailed her hand gently down her skin. \n\n"No! You must help me! Please take these desires away! My husband knows, he's killed my lovers and told me I'd be next if I couldn't control myself!""
WCSS_LIANNE_1_OPT: "Wait, Hold Up!"

WCSS_LIANNE_2_TITLE: "Well Thought Out Plan"
WCSS_LIANNE_2_DESC: ""Let me get this straight, you summoned a demon to make you not want to lay with women?" \n\nThe woman furiously nodded. "I truly try, but the temptation is too much! I'm the Queen! Beautiful maidens practically throw themselves at me... please, I have children!" \n\n"Then why are you naked?" Nazri asked confused. \n\nThe queen looked stunned and then embarrased, "I read that I would have to offer a sacrifice of flesh for a wish." her face then flickered to panic, "I-Is that not how this works?" \n\nNazri erupted in laughter, "Oh you poor thing, had you actually connected to the Twisted Nether you would have had your very soul devoured! Lucky for you, I have more pleasurable interests!" \n\nAs Nazri was about to suggest they "do it until its boring", the door swung open, and she immediately cast Invisibility."
WCSS_LIANNE_2_OPT: "Uh Oh!"

WCSS_LIANNE_3_TITLE: "Domestic Violence"
WCSS_LIANNE_3_DESC: ""Where is she?!" The king stormed into the room in a blind rage, "I heard another woman!" He stomped around looking at every corner. \n\nThe queen was momentarily stunned at the disappearance of the demon, "What woman? I'm here alone, I swear it!" Nazri slowly moved behind the queen and pressed her body against her back, gently cupping the womans breasts as she almost jumped at her touch. \n\n"Do you think me touched woman? You're naked and surrounded by candles! I don't know what trickery you used to hide her, but the consequences are the same. I can't have you corrupting our children with your deviant behavior!" Before she could even respond he turned towards the door, "Men! You have your orders!" Two cloaked guards entered the room. "Remember, don't be seen, I can't have this... jezebel shame me further!" One of them approached her and hit her head with the pummel of a dagger, knocking her unconcious."
WCSS_LIANNE_3_OPT: "Well This Escalated Quickly!"

WCSS_LIANNE_4_TITLE: "Hard Choices"
WCSS_LIANNE_4_DESC: "Nazri had followed the men for hours as they brought the bound and gagged queen deep into a nearby forest. She could see the look of resignation in her unfocused gaze. "I wouldn't lose hope just yet." she whispered into her ear. \n\nThe queen's eyes widened in shock as she had thought the demon long gone. \n\n"I offer you a choice, rejection means I will leave you to your fate." The hope in the queens eyes dimmed at her words. \n\nYou must become my wife and join my harem. Some of the benefits will include eternal beauty, mindblowing pleasures, and did I mention my harem is women only?" She paused, "do you accept the terms?" \n\nThe Queen looked confused for a moment before violently shaking her head yes. Nazri pumped her fist in the air, "Yes!" Her scream immediately drawing the attention of the two guards."
WCSS_LIANNE_4_OPT: "Clear the Trash Mobs!"

WCSS_LIANNE_5_TITLE: "Nehra, I Choose You!"

WCSS_LIANNE_5_OPT: "Murder Time!"

WCSS_LIANNE_6_TITLE: "Quest Reward"
WCSS_LIANNE_6_DESC: "Nazri unsummoned her sister after she dismembered the guard. She turned to the charmed survivor, "You were attacked by gnolls, you were able to flee, but your partner and the queen were killed and likely eaten, now return to your king." He giggled as he turned around and started to walk off.\n\nNazri untied the queen who immediately threw her arms around her as tears ran down her face. "You saved my life!" \n\nNazri's hands started to wander, "Oh, and do I get a reward?" \n\nThe queen blushed, "Perhaps once we get out of this forest..."\n\nNazri grinned as she trailed a finger below her navel, the queen suddenly yelped as fel flames erupted from Nazri's finger, a purple tattoo appeared on her flesh. "Don't worry, it's just the proof of our Pact, it also makes it easier to summon you."\n\n"Summon?""
WCSS_LIANNE_6_OPT: "Cancel Summon!"

WCSS_LIANNE_7_TITLE: "Ritual of Summoning"
WCSS_LIANNE_7_DESC: ""Sis! Draka! Come help me summon!" Nazri shouted. The two entered her room confused, "Just touch the swirly bit until it goes away!"\n\nHer sister was well accustomed to her demands and didn't miss a beat. Draka seemed extremely confused, but followed along. It only took a few seconds before a massive hooded and horned figure sprouted into existance. Draka stepped back as the figure opened its robe revealing a giant portal within it. \n\nNazri then put her hand through the portal and pulled out a confused and naked human woman. "Guys this is... wait what is your name?"\n\n"Lianne." She squeeked out while looking behind her. "Did I just come out of a closet?" \n\n"It does look like a closet doesn't it? This is my sister Nehra and my first wife Draka. Ladies, this is our newest wife!""

Lianne cut in, causing Draka to pause.\n\n"You took her from her children too? What is wrong with you?"\n\n"STOP!" Nazri yelled, "Draka, he's probably halfway across the kingdom by now, but more importantly he's safe and away from the war! And we are very much within the war murder circle where children get murdered!"\n\nShe didn't give Draka time to respond before she turned to Lianne. "Your children think you're dead because your husband ordered your execution! He'd just send people to kill you if he knew you were alive, which would only be fun for my sister!"\n\n"Your children are fine! Maybe try enjoying your new lives!""

Nazri noted.\n\nLianne blushed, "I told you i'm not some sort of exhibitionist!" She ignored Nazri's sceptical look, "I've been thinking about this harem you keep talking about making and I had ideas on the construction of one, once you attain some land."\n\nNazri started to vibrate in excitement, "What kind of ideas?"\n\nLianne pulled out a scroll for her to see, "I've created hundreds of schematics since I was a teenager, but this is my favorite! I have all sorts of ideas though, so if you have any preferences I can change things!"\n\n"This is perfect! Once we have the resources i'll leave it to you!" That would give her time to learn to read it, she thought."

"Probably just had an eye fetish..."\n\nNazri giggled to herself, "He should have named a spell #bold Hand of Gul'dan#! after how much personal time he probably spent with himself!"\n\nLianne had gotten used to Nazri's rants, she was starting to wonder if she ever had a thought she didn't vocalize.\n\n"For some reason, he only tied his vision to the thing!

It's only a temporary spell, but Arcane magic can do so much more! I've been researching a way to do it permanently!" Her expression dropped, "But Dalaran says it isn't possible and i'm wasting my talents, that I should be focusing on Frost magic instead..."\n\nCalia grabbed her hands in hers, "It's not impossible!

WCSS_PRINCESS_10_DESC: ""Are you really Mother?" Calia cried in Lianne's arms.\n\n"I've wanted to hold you in my arms again for so long, it was just too dangerous, you were too young to take with me."\n\n"What happened, they said you died!"\n\n"It was your father, he tried to execute me." Calia looked stunned. "But that's not important, I need you to trust me okay? There is too much to explain, but we need to get you out of here." She broke from her daughters arms before she started her summoning spell.\n\nAs Nazri appeared, Lianne covered her daughters mouth. "I know, she's a demon, but you can't scream!"\n\nNazri giggled as she looked down at Calia, "We've come to rescue you!" Nehra stood out of sight, sulking at the lack of murder."

WCSS_PRINCESS_11_DESC: ""Apparently your betrothed is some super strong mysterious person who's also probably super evil. Your mom found out and was like, "Mistress, you have to save my daughter!" and I was like, "Of course my sex kitten-"\n\n"That's not how that happened!" Lianne interrupted.\n\n"She's just embarassed." Nazri countered, "That's when your mother came up with the plan of you becoming my wife and join my Harem, and then we'll all teleport back home!"\n\nCalia looked to her mother, "You want me to marry a demon?"\n\n"It's just to create a connection so she can summon you, her harem is more of a faction, she just makes everything sound like a sex cult!"\n\n"It's not not a sex cult!" Nazri replied helpfully, giving Calia a seductive wink."

WCSS_PRINCESS_12_TITLE: "The Pitch"
WCSS_PRINCESS_12_DESC: ""So here are the terms, I grant you eternal beauty, mindblowing pleasures, and your mother's favorite part, my harem is women only!"\n\nCalia looked to her mother expecting a protest, instead she saw confirmation.\n\n"And I'd be forced to sleep with this demon?" Calia asked.\n\nNazri looked horrified, "Forced?! Force is what ugly creatures do! I inspire enthusastic consent!"\n\n"I-I didn't mean to offend." Calia was stunned at her apparent faux pas. "You are indeed a... seductive visage. What I mean is, what would I be required to do in this arrangement?"\n\n"You'd have to live with me, of course! Also no men, not even as pets! Nehra has a man-murder addiction and she's very messy!""

WCSS_PRINCESS_13_DESC: ""Nehra is my twin! Let's just say there's a reason we're not with the other Sayaadi, they're pretty upset about the whole incubus fiasco!"\n\nCalia started to look very concerned before her mother interjected, "I know it's a lot to process right now, honey. But put your trust in me, I would never let anyone hurt you!"\n\nCalia looked at her mother's loving expression and nodded, "Okay, I will trust you."\n\n"Yes! My first Princess!" Nazri jumped in victory as Lianne sighed.\n\nNazri placed her hand on Calia's stomach. Calia could feel a warmth bloom inside her.\n\n"You're going to have so much fun!" Nazri promised."

WCSS_PRINCESS_14_DESC: ""I have to say, this place is not what I expected," Calia paused. "In a good way! U-um, I was hoping I could ask you a favor."\n\n"A sexy favor?" Nazri lit up.\n\n"N-no! I-it's about my best friend," Calia stuttered. "Her name is Jaina, and she's going to be the strongest archmage to ever live! Her dream is to master Arcane magic and make a #bold True Polymorph#! spell, but everyone around her keeps pushing her to do Frost magic instead! I think the Archmages in Dalaran are afraid of her potential and are trying to ruin it."\n\n"You had me at the strongest archmage to ever live!"\n\nCalia lit up, "The only problem is she's in Dalaran! She's surrounded by the strongest Mages in the world!"\n\n"Hmm, I know just who to talk to!""

WCSS_PRINCESS_15_DESC: ""So you want to elope with your best friend who's in perhaps the most impenetrable city in the world?" Lianne summarized.\n\n"I'm not trying to elope!" Calia blushed as her mother raised her brow.\n\n"Oh! It's like one of the books i've been reading: My Mage Mistress: Bound by Magic." Nazri interjected.\n\n"It's not like that!" Calia protested harder.\n\nLianne smiled at her daughter's floundering. "There is one way. Dalaran might be impenetrable, but that doesn't mean we can't make Jaina come to us. The hard part will be convincing her to join once she does."\n\n"I can convince her, I know it!"\n\n"Alright, let me teach you the art of a secret rendezvous!""

WCSS_PRINCESS_16_DESC: ""Calia is missing?" Jaina was stunned.\n\n"Father claims she must have run away to avoid the betrothal, but without telling me? She wouldn't do that! She knows how important she is to me! She wouldn't abandon me like that!" Arthas cried. "She must have been taken, lights above, maybe murdered! I can't have failed her like my father failed my mother!"\n\nJaina was barely comprehending his words, she was still trying to digest the news.\n\n"If you hear anything can you notify me immediately?" Arthas asked.\n\n"Let me see what I can find!" Jaina shouted as she she rushed off to her room in a panic.\n\nAs she entered her room she froze. A letter laid on her bed." 
WCSS_PRINCESS_16_OPT: "How'd That Get There?"

WCSS_PRINCESS_17_TITLE: "The Redezvous"
WCSS_PRINCESS_17_DESC: ""All of this is hard to believe; rogue demons, your father under some type of mind control, and even your mother being alive?" Jaina sat next to Calia.\n\n"I know it's a lot to take in, but trust me when I say we are facing more enemies than the world knows. Will you join us?"\n\n"If what you're saying is true then isn't it more reason I should be in Dalaran, I could tell the council!"\n\nCalia frowned, "The same people that keeps pushing you to study Frost magic? Jaina, how do you know they are not trying to lead you astray? If you're some sort of genius, why aren't they encouraging your ideas, why are they forcing you down a different path?"\n\n"You may call me paranoid, but I don't trust them! But I believe in you! I believe in your dreams, even when no one else does! Even when you don't believe in yourself!""

WCSS_PRINCESS_18_DESC: ""I wanted to meet you in person before I made my decision. What are your goals demon?" Nazri giggled as if she was preparing for this moment.\n\n"#Bold First!#! Find all the most powerful women in the world and have them join my Harem!"\n\n"#Bold Second!#! Have all their forces defend us from the jealous men!"\n\n"#Bold Third!#!" Nazri paused, "Uhh, something something..."\n\n"#Bold Fourth!#! We beat up all the bad guys and take over the world!"\n\nJaina stared at her in disbelief, "All the women? From all the races? You want to unite all of Azeroth?"\n\n"Azeroth is just the start! There's a lot more worlds out there! Have you seen Draenei women yet?" Nazri kissed her fingers."

The girls blushed.\n\n"You know, Nehra told me I shouldn't tell people my plan, because then they would never take me seriously. Looks like she underestimated me!" Nazri laughed. "You already know the terms of the pact, right?"\n\n"Eternal youth, A succubus trying to bed me, and living inside some type of misandrist sex cult."\n\nNazri laughed, "I don't hate men, Jaina." Her voice darkened and her expression turned predatory as she whispered in her ear, "They just bring out a darker type of desire in me!"\n\nShe licked her lips as her fingers trailed down Jaina's stomach."

Nazri laughed, "But i'll make an exception, no telling anyone though, okay?"\n\nJaina nodded. "All Sayaadi are born as succubi. However, we are able to change our sex, which are called incubi."\n\n"If you can change your forms where are all the incubi?"\n\n"The change is... thorough. The body shapes much of how you feel and think, which can create a dangerous synergy in succubi."\n\n"Wait, this ability changes your actual form? It's not an illusion? Could you teach me how it works?""

Think about the possibilities, you'd be changing the very fabric of reality to your whims!"\n\n"Yeah, but why would you want to make more men?"\n\nJaina just stared at Nazri for a few moments, "Cause I could turn men into women instead?"\n\nNazri's eye's went wide, "Wait! That's like... twice as many women!"\n\n"Well, no..." Jaina said defeatedly, "But sure!""

She had one hand around her throat, her face an inch from hers, "If this is a trick, your Mistress won't be able to protect you!"\n\nLianne was stunned, Draka had always been hostile, but she had never tried to physically harm her before, "S-show you!"
